# Leazy - linux-eazy for lazy people
Made to work on ubuntu, but should work on more distros. I made this to have my enviroment quickly installed on each debloat/clean install of my pc. And also because you can do this quite easily on linux. And also I can :D

--And you can as well! [Fork leazy](https://github.com/michondr/leazy/fork) and be lazy!-- 

## How does it work?

theory is that you insert your password only once, so that the script can execute in single run. Then each topic (subdir) is executed by its own sh script.

## Installation
you can run this fresh after install: 
```
sudo apt --assume-yes -qq install git
git clone https://github.com/michondr/leazy.git
cd leazy/
sh do.sh
```
